# First thing needed is outlier ID

library(anomalize)

# We detect observations outside the interquartile range using the `anomalize` package - 
# which is an outlier analysis package designed to play well with the tidyverse.

# We start by creating a data frame called `outliers` where we use the 
# `iqr` function to create new columns (denoted as variable.outlier) that simply 
# consist of "Yes" or "No" observations that denote whether the relevant observation 
# is outside the interquartile range for that variable across our entire data set.

# The parameters of the `iqr` function are described as follows in the `anomlalize` 
# [reference material](https://business-science.github.io/anomalize/reference/anomalize.html):
  
#  "The IQR Method uses an interquartile range of 25 the median. With the default alpha = 0.05, 
# the limits are established by expanding the 25/75 baseline by an IQR Factor of 3 (3X). 
# The IQR Factor = 0.15 / alpha (hence 3X with alpha = 0.05). 
# To increase the IQR Factor controling the limits, decrease the alpha, 
# which makes it more difficult to be an outlier. 
# Increase alpha to make it easier to be an outlier."

# BM: We should have this group by subject. First step of outlier removal should be to remove outliers within participant.
# BM: After that, we could also have a check to see if participants themselves on average are outliers, which is unlikely, but worth checking.
