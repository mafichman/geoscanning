#  Calculate Stay Events
#  
#  This function calculates stay events based on spatial locations and time stamps of mobility data. A distance 
#  threshold and a time threshold are given to determine if points are in the same stay event set. The centroid 
#  of points in one stay event set is calculated as the spatial location of the stay event. 
#  
#  @param df a data frame object. 
#  @param coor longitude and latitude of the spatial points in the format of c("lon","lat").
#  @param time a POSIXct time object, used to calculate time period. 
#  @param dist.threshold a distance threshold used to determine if points are in the same group. The 
#  format is numeric. Unit is meters.
#  @param time.threshold a numeric object. Value should have the same unit specified in the \code{time.units} 
#  parameter. 
#  @param time.units a character string indicating which units time difference is caluclated in. 
#  @param groupvar grouping object to stratify time objects. Recommend to be ID for each individual. 
#  If \code{groupvar} is not specified, \code{time.units} will be used to sort data and calculate radius of gyration.
#  
#  @return a data frame with three new columns added showing stayevents and locations. 
#  
#  @note \code{stayevent} function doesn t sort the data frame. It is recommended to sort data frame based on 
#  time and then run the function.
