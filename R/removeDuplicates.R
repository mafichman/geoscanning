# removeDuplicates.R

# INCOMPLETE PENDING COMMENTS FROM TOM

# This function removes duplicated timestamps using a logic
# that tries to determine which duplicate is most likely to be an outlier based
# on time/space lag readings

# First remove exact duplicates where coordinates and time are exactly the same
# Then create rolling averages for lat and lon, grouping by filename and ordering by timestamp
# Rolling averages are computed separately for lead and lag and then these are averaged by timestamp
# Then let's calculate the distance between the actual lat/lon and the rolling lat/lon (e.g. center of mass)
# We call this dist_ctrGravity.
# Then we group by filename and datetime (e.g. each id/timestamp combo),
# We rank them by dist_ctrGravity (smallest first)
# And keep only the first obs (e.g. slice(1))
# We then ungroup and ditch most of the new variables we made
