#stayevent_nas.R

# stayevent() from the Mobility package assigns stayeventgroup IDs only to observations that are flagged as stay events, assigning NA to the rest.
# stayevent_nas() assigns a unique stayeventgroup ID for all NAs.

# Input: dataframe that was just processed by Mobility::stayevent()
# Output: dataframe with a non-NA value for each observation under dataframe$stayeventgroup

# Observations tagged with "NA" at the start are not actually stay events.
