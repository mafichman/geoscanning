# geoscanning
 
This is a test repository for the geoscanning project from Falk Lab. Everything is under construction and documentation is sparse at the moment.

For questions - contact @mafichman

To do basic data cleaning, clone the repo to your comupter, use the file `simple_codebase.R` to load functions, execute code and write out data and a workspace to your computer.

This repo contains no subject data, only demo geotracking data and retailer data from public records.
