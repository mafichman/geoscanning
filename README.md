# geoscanning
 
This is a test repository for the geoscanning project from Falk Lab. Everything is under construction and documentation is sparse at the moment.

For questions - contact @mafichman

To do basic data cleaning, clone the repo to your comupter, use the file `simple_codebase.R` to load functions, execute code and write out data and a workspace to your computer.

This repo contains no subject data, only demo geotracking data and retailer data from public records.

The organization is as follows:

## Repo organization

### Data (Folder)

Contains retailer data and sample geotracking data

### Documentation (Folder)

Contains markdowns describing retailer DL and cleaning process and an (always) in process codebase which documents the functions and code used in the project. Contains subfolders including a folder called `dataModel` which has an illustrator file where there is ongoing diagramming of the project workflow. There is also a folder marked "Archived" with ancestral copies of the codebase.

### R (Folder)

Functions which can be called into code such as the `simple_codebase.R` file in order to clean, join and analyze geotracking data.

### Files

`simple_codebase.R` - a simplified data cleaning and spatial joining routine

`geoscanning.Rproj` - an R project file
